* Alena's Battery Blink

** About

X11 window to blink via a key binding,
even on top of full screen windows,
and not require a shift of the eyes.
It's yellow if charging.

A battery alarm is also easy to make.
Though coming up with this wasn't easy.

#+begin_src sh
  while sleep 5; do albatwid -o 30; done &
#+end_src

"wid" stands for "widget".
That's what I called it before uploading it.

** Usage

#+begin_src sh
  git clone https://github.com/TheodoreAlenas/battery-blink
  cd battery-blink
  make test
  ./albatwid --help
#+end_src

Then tweaks to ~main.c~ and ~make test~ repeatedly, finally

#+begin_src sh
  cp albatwid ~/.local/bin
#+end_src

at least God bless it's that easy. Otherwise, you know,

#+begin_src sh
  sudo cp albatwid /usr/local/bin/
#+end_src

or look around in the ~/usr~ for some ~bin/~ that
seems to be local by some definition of local.

What I do is, I have this in my ~.xinitrc~

#+begin_src sh
  while sleep 5; do albatwid -o 50; done &
#+end_src

because I have this problem where the battery falls to zero
suddenly when it gets somewhere below 50.

And I've bound ~Super + F~ to call ~albatwid~.
Actually, I'm on Dvorak so it's ~Super + U~. Oh yeah!

** Inspiration

I used to have a Python app that acted in a similar way,
and it looked nice.
It was the first all nighter that I ever pulled off,
I remember those days I was under pressure
and I didn't know how to control that,
I'm sure it's an interesting story but I don't remember it.

Over time it started to look nice,
like a battery with rounded corners,
and with a thunder symbol and
with lines showing where's 25% 50% and 75%,
it was nice and the code was nice too.

But it couldn't overlay full screen windows.
I didn't know how to fix that.

So I thought to take DMenu, another open source project,
and rip it apart to make this thing.

Ripping it was too hard so I squiggled around in it's code
and I tried copying minimal snippets and I pieced this
project together. It actually only took one day.

I don't know. I like it.
